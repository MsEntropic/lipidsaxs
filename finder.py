This programme takes a file containing I(q) vs q data, and return an array of locations of Bragg peaks in the data.

It works by firstly finding an approximate location  of Bragg peaks in the data, eliminating peaks which fall outside of a
user-defined range, which will eliminate beamstop and detector noise at low and high values of q respectively. It then uses
the lmfit library to fit a convolution of a Voigt peak and a linear background to a range around the peak.

NB: The fitting range is hard-coded as the 7 points either side of the initially found peak in the discretised data, so care 
should be taken with regards to this fact if you are fitting data with much broader peaks. The programme will then remove peaks
which have been found multiple times by the inital search. If a figure of the q vs. I(q) data overlaid with lines where the 
peaks have been fitted to in q is wanted, this can then be displayed if wanted - defined by one of the programme parameters.

pass the following parameters to this function:
    file_name - the full file path to the I vs q data that you want to find Bragg peaks in. Must be formatted q in first (0)
                column, I(q) in second (1) column
    
    finding_sensitivity - how sensitive the programme needs to be to finding peaks. The lower the number is the more sensitive
                          the programme will be. If there is a lower background, this value can be quite high (ie >40). For 
                          noisier data, ~8 will suffice.
                         
    lo_lim, hi_lim - these are parameters specifying the low and high limits of the q range of where the peaks can be found.
    
    fig - set this to 1 if you would like a figure returned of the I vs q data on a log(I) plot complete with overlaid lines
          of where the peaks have been found - and returned.
